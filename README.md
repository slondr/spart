spart is a library for building Spartan clients. It works!

To use it, add this to your Cargo.toml:
```toml
spart = { git = "https://git.sr.ht/~slondr/spart" }
```

spart is extremely simple to use. For an example client (about 4 lines of Rust), see: https://git.sr.ht/~slondr/achaea/tree/master/item/src/main.rs
